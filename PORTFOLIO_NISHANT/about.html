      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS,
        and JavaScript. Over the past few years, I've worked on a range of
        projects, from small personal websites to more complex applications. I
        love building user-friendly, visually appealing websites that combine
        clean code with modern design.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to front-end technologies, I am skilled in back-end
        development, including Java, Python, and SQL, as well as frameworks like
        Spring Boot and Django. This enables me to create full-stack web
        applications that are efficient, scalable, and secure.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am continuously learning new technologies and staying updated with
        industry trends to enhance my skill set. My goal is to craft web
        solutions that not only look great but also provide a seamless user
        experience. In addition to my technical expertise, I value communication
        and collaboration, which allows me to work effectively with clients and
        teams to bring ideas to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring the latest web design trends and
        refining my skills through continuous learning. Let's connect and build
        something amazing together.
